## Why RAG Matters in 2025
In an era drowning in unstructured data—documents, PDFs, PRDs, and more—traditional keyword search just doesn’t cut it.  
**Retrieval‑Augmented Generation (RAG)** combines the power of vector search with large language models (LLMs) to deliver fact‑driven, context‑aware answers.  
- **Accuracy boost:** Cuts hallucinations by grounding responses in your own data.  
- **Scalability:** From a few hundred documents to millions, RAG adapts effortlessly.  
- **Versatility:** Ideal for customer support chatbots, content generation, research assistants, and more.

## 4 Steps to AI‑Powered Retrieval
1. **Ingest**  
   Connect your data sources. Dcup continuously syncs new files so you always query up‑to‑date content.  
2. **Process**  
   Data is split into chunks and transformed into embeddings—think “digital DNA” of your text.  
3. **Store & Index**  
   Qdrant stores these vectors with optimized indexes for sub‑second similarity search.  
4. **Retrieve**  
   Ask questions via our REST API or UI. Get back precise, contextually rich answers fueled by LLMs.
