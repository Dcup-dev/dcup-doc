title: Cloud Dcup
description: Welcome to Dcup! This guide will walk you through creating an account, setting up a connection to your data (like Google Drive, Dropbox, AWS, or direct uploads), and configuring it to work with your files. Let’s get started!
---

## Step 1: Create an Account
### Visit the App: Go to app.dcup.dev and Sign Up
[app.dcup.dev](https://app.dcup.dev)
#### Once you’re in, you’re ready to start connecting your data!

## Step 2: Go to Connections
-  Head to app.dcup.dev/connections.
#### This is where you’ll see any existing connections and create new ones.


## Step 3: Create a New Connection
### Start a Connection: On the connections page, click "New Connection".
#### Pick Your Source: Choose where your data lives:
- Google Drive: You’ll be asked to log in and let Dcup access your Drive.
- Dropbox: Same deal—log in and link your Dropbox account.
- AWS: Enter your AWS details to connect to your S3 buckets.
- Direct Upload: Upload files straight from your computer to Dcup’s vector database.


## Step 4: Configure the Connection
### Now, set up your connection so it works just the way you want:
- Give It a Unique Name: Type in a name that’s easy to recognize, like "Marketing Docs" or "AWS Project Files".
- Choose Your Source Details:
  - Google Drive or Dropbox: Pick the folder you want to connect.
  - AWS: Select the S3 bucket you’re using and folder.
  - Direct Upload: Your uploaded files are already set here.
- Add Metadata: Add tags or labels (like "team":"design") to make searching easier later.
- Set Limits:
  - Decide how many files and folders to process. This keeps things manageable—start small if you’re unsure!

Review: Double-check your settings.

## Step 5: Save and Let It Run
- Save It: Click "Save" to lock in your connection.
- Background Magic: The app will start processing your files in the background—chunking them, embedding them, and storing them in the vector database.
- Keep Going: You don’t have to wait; you can use the app while it works.
- You’ll get a heads-up when it’s done!

## Step 6: Sync New Files
#### Added new files to your Google Drive, Dropbox, AWS bucket, or want to upload more? Keep your connection fresh:
- Back to Connections: Go to app.dcup.dev/connections.
- Find Your Connection: Look for the one you want to sync.
- Sync It: Hit the "Sync" button to process the new files.
- Updated: The new stuff will be added to your vector database.

#### Repeat this whenever you add more files!

## What’s Next?
You’re all set! Your data is connected, processed, and ready to use. Want to search or do more with it? 
- Go to query page and make search , you can use filter to narrow your search more
