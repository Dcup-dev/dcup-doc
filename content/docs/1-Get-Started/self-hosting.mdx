title: Self-Host Dcup
description: This guide will help you set up Dcup—your self-hostable RAG-as-a-Service platform—and show you how to interact with its Retrieval API using JavaScript
---
# 1. Installation
## Prerequisites
- Docker & Docker Compose: Ensure both are installed and running.

## Steps to Install
1. Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dcup-dev/dcup.git
cd dcup
```
2. Configure Your Environment:
    - Duplicate the sample environment file:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    - Open the `.env` file in your favorite editor and update the settings (e.g., API keys, database connection strings).

3. Launch Dcup with Docker Compose:
Start all required services (Postgres, Redis, Qdrant, and Dcup) by running:
```bash 
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml --env-file .env up --detach --remove-orphans
```
This command builds the images (if needed), creates the containers, and runs the application in the background.

# 2. Using Dcup
- Access the UI :
Once the containers are running, open your browser and navigate to:
```bash
http://localhost:8080
```
The intuitive UI is designed to help you manage your data ingestion, chunking, and indexing processes easily—even if you're not a tech expert.

## How the Pipeline Works
### Data Ingestion:
Connect to data sources like Google Drive. New files are automatically fetched, and you can attach metadata or set limits on the number of files/pages to process.

### Chunking & Embedding:
In the background, Dcup reads each file, splits it into chunks, and sends each chunk to OpenAI for generating a title, summary, and embeddings.

### Storage & Indexing:
These enriched chunks are stored in Qdrant for robust indexing and fast retrieval. Redis is used for caching metadata.

### Retrieval:
Use the Retrieval API to search your indexed data. The API expands your query, generates embeddings, and retrieves matching chunks using advanced filtering and re-ranking.

# 3. Quick Start with the Retrieval API
## API Endpoint
### Endpoint: `POST /api/retrievals`
## Request Format
Include the following parameters in your JSON request body:
- **query (string, required)**: Your search query (min. 2 characters).
- **top_chunk (number, optional)**: Number of top results to return (default: 5).
- **filter (object, optional)**: Filter criteria to narrow down results.
- **rerank (boolean, optional)**: Set to true to enable re-ranking (default: false).
- **min_score_threshold (number, optional)**: Minimum score threshold for results.
Example Request
```json
{
  "query": "example search query",
  "top_chunk": 5,
  "filter": {
    "field": "value"
  },
  "rerank": true,
  "min_score_threshold": 0.5
}
````
#### JavaScript Usage Example
Below is an example of how you can use JavaScript and the Fetch API to send a request to Dcup's Retrieval API:
```js
// Replace with your actual API key
const API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE';

const requestData = {
  query: "example search query",
  top_chunk: 5,
  filter: { field: "value" },
  rerank: true,
  min_score_threshold: 0.5
};

fetch('http://localhost:8080/api/retrievals', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${API_KEY}`
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(requestData)
})
  .then(response => {
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`Server error: ${response.status}`);
    }
    return response.json();
  })
  .then(data => {
    console.log('Retrieved Chunks:', data.scored_chunks);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
  });
```
### How It Works
- Prepare the Request:
Build a JSON object with your search query and parameters.

#### Send the Request:
- Use the Fetch API to POST your request to `http://localhost:8080/api/retrievals` along with your API key.

#### Process the Response:
- The API returns a JSON response with an array of scored chunks, which include details such as document name, page number, content, and score.

### Example Response
A successful response will return a JSON object with an array of scored chunks:
```json
{
  "scored_chunks": [
    {
      "id": "chunk_1",
      "document_name": "Document A",
      "page_number": 1,
      "chunk_number": 2,
      "source": "Google Drive",
      "title": "Introduction",
      "summary": "Overview of the topic",
      "content": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...",
      "type": "text",
      "metadata": {},
      "score": 0.87
    }
    // ...more chunks
  ]
}
```
# 4. Next Steps
## Explore:
Once set up, experiment with uploading data, configuring metadata, and testing the retrieval API.
